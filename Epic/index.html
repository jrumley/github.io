                <p>The Robotic Casepacker Cell that is shown above is a custom application for a major food producer. The cell can be constructed out of painted steel, aluminum, and stainless steel. The base design is created to be adjustable to many different products and box sizes. It is capable of 65 picks per minute with a single scara robot or 130 picks per minute with a 2 robot model. Please view the video to the right and see this setup in action. Currently this cell design is running over 99% efficient.</p>

                                Our experience with Staubli has propelled us to a new level of automation. In searching for an opportunity to integrate robotics into our case packing automation scheme, Staubli Robotics provided a top tier solution. American Pop Corn Company and Staubli have both been around for over a century and the emphasis on quality, value and loyalty make for an ideal alliance. The initial groundwork, the staged training and implementation and the final installation could not have gone more smoothly. Our stated goal was to drive efficiency, remove a significant source of manual repetitive motion and capture a decent ROI. We accomplished all of the above and are already looking for more solutions from your group.

                                The Robot has been extremely reliable since installation. Staubli has built a machine that will deliver accuracy beyond what is required for our packaging. The Cell is robust and attractive. Very solidly built, ready to be the center of attention.
